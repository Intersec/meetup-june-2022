This repository contains the examples presented during the meetup on June 29th
2002 on how to use lib-common.

== Quickstart

=== Prerequisites

First, you need to install all the
https://github.com/Intersec/lib-common/#quickstart[lib-common prerequisites
and dependencies].

=== Build

First of all, you have to configure your project, by running in the top-level
directory:
---------------------------------
meetup-june-2022$ waf configure
---------------------------------

By default, it will use gcc. You can also use clang by defining the two
environment variables `CC` and `CXX`:
---------------------------------
meetup-june-2022$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ waf configure
---------------------------------

If the configuration step triggers no error, then you are ready to build.
Go into the `src` directory and run the following command:
----------------------------------
meetup-june-2022$ cd src
meetup-june-2022/src$ waf
----------------------------------

=== Run

You can now run the `wordcount` program:
----------------------------------
meetup-june-2022/src$ ./wordcount <file_path>
----------------------------------
